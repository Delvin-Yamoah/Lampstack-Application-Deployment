# LAMP Stack Application with Full Proxy and Monitoring Setup

## AWS Management Console Approach

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack application deployment on AWS with comprehensive monitoring, logging, and observability. The application is deployed behind a reverse proxy (Application Load Balancer) with auto-scaling capabilities, following AWS Well-Architected Framework principles.

**Key Differentiator**: This project uses primarily AWS Management Console-based approaches, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical team members while providing detailed rationales for every decision.
