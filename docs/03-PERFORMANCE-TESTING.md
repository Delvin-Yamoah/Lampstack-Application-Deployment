## AWS Management Console-Based Testing Approach

### Phase 1: Baseline Performance Measurement

#### Why Establish Baselines?
**Business Rationale:** You need to know your current performance to measure improvements and detect degradation.

**Technical Rationale:** Baselines help identify when performance changes and whether changes are improvements or regressions.

#### Step 1: Set Up CloudWatch Synthetics for Continuous Testing

**What you're doing:** Creating automated tests that run continuously
**Why this approach:** Provides consistent, repeatable testing without manual intervention

1. **Navigate to CloudWatch Synthetics**
   - AWS Console → CloudWatch → Synthetics → "Create canary"
   - *Why Synthetics*: Simulates real user interactions from AWS infrastructure

2. **Create Performance Baseline Canary**
   - Blueprint: "Heartbeat monitoring"
   - Name: `lamp-stack-performance-baseline`
   - URL: Your Application Load Balancer DNS name
   - Frequency: Every 5 minutes
   - *Why every 5 minutes*: Frequent enough to catch issues quickly, not so frequent as to impact performance
   - *Business impact*: Continuous monitoring catches performance degradation immediately

3. **Configure Advanced Settings**
   - Success criteria: Response time < 2 seconds AND Status code = 200
   - Failure threshold: 2 consecutive failures
   - *Why 2 seconds*: Industry standard for acceptable web performance
   - *Why 2 failures*: Avoids false alarms from temporary network issues

#### Step 2: Create Multi-Step User Journey Test

**What you're doing:** Testing complete user workflows, not just single pages
**Why this matters:** Real users don't just visit one page - they navigate through your application

1. **Create API Workflow Canary**
   - Blueprint: "API canary"
   - Name: `lamp-stack-user-journey`
   - *Purpose*: Test the complete user experience

2. **Configure Multi-Step Test**
   ```javascript
   // Step 1: Load homepage
   await synthetics.executeStep('loadHomepage', async function () {
       await page.goto('http://your-alb-dns/', {waitUntil: 'networkidle0'});
   });
   
   // Step 2: Test API endpoint
   await synthetics.executeStep('testAPI', async function () {
       const response = await page.goto('http://your-alb-dns/api.php');
       if (!response.ok()) {
           throw new Error('API request failed');
       }
   });
   
   // Step 3: Test user creation page
   await synthetics.executeStep('loadUserForm', async function () {
       await page.goto('http://your-alb-dns/create_user.php', {waitUntil: 'networkidle0'});
   });
   ```
   - *Why multi-step*: Catches issues that only appear during complex user interactions
   - *Business impact*: Ensures complete user workflows function correctly

### Phase 2: Load Testing via AWS Console

#### Why Use AWS-Native Load Testing?
**Business Rationale:** AWS-native tools integrate seamlessly with your monitoring and don't require additional infrastructure.

**Technical Rationale:** Tests run from AWS infrastructure, providing realistic network conditions and automatic integration with CloudWatch.

#### Step 1: Set Up CloudWatch Synthetics Load Testing

**What you're doing:** Creating multiple canaries to simulate concurrent users
**Why this approach:** Distributed testing from multiple AWS regions simulates real user traffic patterns

1. **Create Multiple Regional Canaries**
   - Create canary in us-east-1: `lamp-stack-load-east`
   - Create canary in us-west-2: `lamp-stack-load-west`
   - Create canary in eu-west-1: `lamp-stack-load-europe`
   - *Why multiple regions*: Simulates global user base and tests CDN/routing performance
   - *Business impact*: Ensures good performance for users worldwide

2. **Configure Concurrent Load Pattern**
   - Set each canary to run every 1 minute
   - Stagger start times by 20 seconds
   - *Why staggered*: Creates continuous load without synchronized spikes
   - *Result*: Simulates 3 concurrent users with requests every 20 seconds

#### Step 2: Monitor Performance During Load Tests

**What you're doing:** Watching how your system responds to increased load
**Why real-time monitoring matters:** Identifies performance degradation patterns and scaling triggers

1. **Create Load Testing Dashboard**
   - CloudWatch → Dashboards → "Create dashboard"
   - Name: `LAMP-Stack-Load-Testing`
   - *Purpose*: Centralized view of performance during testing

2. **Add Key Performance Widgets**
   - **Response Time Widget**
     - Metric: Synthetics → CanaryName → Duration
     - *Why monitor*: Shows if response times increase under load
     - *Business impact*: Slow responses lose customers
   
   - **Success Rate Widget**
     - Metric: Synthetics → CanaryName → SuccessPercent
     - *Why monitor*: Shows if errors increase under load
     - *Business impact*: Errors directly impact user experience
   
   - **EC2 CPU Utilization**
     - Metric: EC2 → CPUUtilization (all instances)
     - *Why monitor*: Shows if servers are being stressed
     - *Technical insight*: Helps identify when scaling should occur
   
   - **Load Balancer Request Count**
     - Metric: ApplicationELB → RequestCount
     - *Why monitor*: Confirms load is being distributed
     - *Business insight*: Shows actual traffic patterns

### Phase 3: Auto Scaling Testing

#### Why Test Auto Scaling?
**Business Rationale:** Auto scaling is your safety net for handling unexpected traffic spikes - it must work when needed.

**Technical Rationale:** Scaling policies need validation under real conditions to ensure they trigger appropriately.

#### Step 1: Create Scaling Test Scenario

**What you're doing:** Deliberately triggering auto scaling to verify it works
**Why this is critical:** Scaling failures during real traffic spikes can cause outages

1. **Set Up Scaling Trigger Monitoring**
   - CloudWatch → Dashboards → Add widget
   - Metric: Auto Scaling → GroupName → GroupDesiredCapacity
   - *Why monitor desired capacity*: Shows when scaling decisions are made
   - *Business impact*: Confirms system can handle growth automatically

2. **Create CPU Load Test via Systems Manager**
   - AWS Console → Systems Manager → Run Command
   - Document: "AWS-RunShellScript"
   - Targets: Select one of your EC2 instances
   - Command: `stress --cpu 2 --timeout 600s`
   - *Why use Systems Manager*: No need to SSH into instances
   - *Why stress CPU*: Triggers the scaling policy based on CPU utilization

#### Step 2: Monitor Scaling Behavior

**What you're doing:** Observing how quickly and effectively your system scales
**Why timing matters:** Slow scaling can still result in poor user experience during traffic spikes

1. **Track Scaling Metrics**
   - **Scale-Out Time**: Time from alarm trigger to new instance serving traffic
   - **Scale-In Time**: Time from low utilization to instance termination
   - **Target**: Scale-out < 5 minutes, Scale-in < 10 minutes
   - *Why these targets*: Balance between responsiveness and cost optimization

2. **Verify Load Distribution**
   - Monitor: ApplicationELB → TargetGroup → HealthyHostCount
   - Expected: Count increases as new instances come online
   - *Why monitor*: Ensures new instances are properly integrated
   - *Business impact*: Confirms scaling actually improves capacity

### Phase 4: Database Performance Testing

#### Why Database Testing is Critical
**Business Rationale:** Database bottlenecks often cause the most severe performance issues and can lead to complete service failure.

**Technical Rationale:** Database performance affects every aspect of your application and is often the limiting factor for scalability.

#### Step 1: Monitor Database Performance Under Load

**What you're doing:** Watching database metrics during load testing
**Why database monitoring is different:** Database issues often don't show up in application metrics until it's too late

1. **Create Database Performance Dashboard**
   - CloudWatch → Dashboards → "Create dashboard"
   - Name: `LAMP-Stack-Database-Performance`

2. **Add Critical Database Metrics**
   - **Connection Count**
     - Metric: RDS → DatabaseConnections
     - Alert threshold: 80% of maximum
     - *Why monitor*: Connection exhaustion prevents new users from accessing the application
     - *Business impact*: Ensures application remains accessible under load
   
   - **CPU Utilization**
     - Metric: RDS → CPUUtilization
     - Alert threshold: 80%
     - *Why monitor*: High CPU slows down all database operations
     - *Business impact*: Prevents database slowdowns that affect all users
   
   - **Read/Write Latency**
     - Metrics: RDS → ReadLatency, WriteLatency
     - Alert threshold: 200ms
     - *Why monitor*: Database latency directly impacts application response time
     - *Business impact*: Maintains responsive user experience

#### Step 2: Test Database Connection Limits

**What you're doing:** Verifying your database can handle expected connection loads
**Why connection testing matters:** Connection limits are often the first database bottleneck encountered

1. **Use RDS Performance Insights**
   - RDS Console → Your database → "Performance Insights"
   - Monitor during load testing
   - *Why Performance Insights*: Provides detailed analysis without impacting database performance
   - *Key metrics to watch*: Top SQL statements, wait events, database load

2. **Analyze Connection Patterns**
   - Look for: Connection spikes, long-running queries, lock waits
   - *Why analyze patterns*: Helps optimize application database usage
   - *Business benefit*: Prevents database-related outages

### Phase 5: Real User Monitoring (RUM)

#### Why Real User Monitoring Matters
**Business Rationale:** Synthetic tests can't replicate all real-world conditions - actual user data provides the complete picture.

**Technical Rationale:** Real user data includes network conditions, device performance, and usage patterns that synthetic tests miss.

#### Step 1: Set Up CloudWatch RUM

**What you're doing:** Collecting performance data from actual users' browsers
**Why this is valuable:** Shows how your application actually performs for real users

1. **Create RUM Application**
   - CloudWatch → RUM → "Create app monitor"
   - Name: `lamp-stack-rum`
   - Domain: Your application domain
   - *Why RUM*: Captures real user experience data

2. **Configure Data Collection**
   - Enable: Page load times, JavaScript errors, HTTP requests
   - Sample rate: 10% (to control costs)
   - *Why 10% sampling*: Provides statistically significant data while controlling costs
   - *Business value*: Understand actual user experience

#### Step 2: Analyze Real User Performance

**What you're doing:** Using real user data to identify performance issues
**Why real data matters:** Synthetic tests might miss issues that only affect certain users or conditions

1. **Monitor Key RUM Metrics**
   - **Page Load Time**: How long pages take to load for real users
   - **JavaScript Errors**: Client-side errors that affect functionality
   - **AJAX Performance**: How fast your API calls are for real users
   - *Why these metrics*: Directly correlate with user satisfaction and business metrics

2. **Create Performance Alerts**
   - Alert when: 95th percentile page load time > 3 seconds
   - Alert when: JavaScript error rate > 1%
   - *Why 95th percentile*: Ensures good experience for nearly all users
   - *Business impact*: Proactive identification of user experience issues
